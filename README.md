# recovering_JPEGs
Recovers deleted JPEG image files from a memory card. This is a problem
from the Harvard cs50 course Problem Set 4 and the raw data card.raw is
provided with the problem set.

It is assumed that the memory card had been "zeroed" before the photos
(which were subsequently deleted) were taken.
